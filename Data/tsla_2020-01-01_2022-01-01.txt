51. Dear Chris,You're 100% right. Welcome to The Realization™, when someone realizes that Elon Musk is a crook, and feels obligated to warn society about the ongoing evil which has been happening for years now. #Tesla $TSLA $TSLAQ

52. 2022 stock predictions from @profgalloway: $FB The Zuckerverse is the biggest tech fail of 2022.$GME and $AMC stock will be below $10 per share.$TSLA, $RIVN, and $LCID stocks will be cut in half.

54. Wow. If close or better. People are underestimating the manufacturing efficiency that Tesla is creating from ground up. Tesla is putting American manufacturing back on the map! $TSLA #Tesla

55. Ending 2021 with a mini $TSLA share buying spree at $1060 as I look forward to my Model X getting delivered in August.

56. Not the prettiest of inside days or candle, and closed just below 50sma on decelerating volume all week. Nice flag built. This is not surprising to me though. Make or break time next week. Could easily shakeout further then turn higher or just pop from here too $TSLA

57. 475,000 $TSLA Tesla cars are being recalled for defects.  That is all the vehicles delivered in 2020...all of them.

58. I hope everyone has a great new year! Joined Twitter this year and have met some amazing people and learned more than I ever have about investing. I hope you all set some goals and smash them!!2022 will be your year! $mmat $bbig $tsla

59. @TheSageofTrades had some fun memories in 2021 laughing and engaging with the $DWAC fiasco in October and trading $TSLA like a boss. Next year, he hopes to get his Beginners Market Analysis course out and sign to an incredible NFT / Metaverse project team.

60. We'll likely see some good buy volume the last 3 min. $TSLA

61. How could anyone have no $TSLA shares at this point? 

62. 2/ Wouldn’t it be insane if $TSLA FY’21 production came in at the 934,091 repeated number in Elon’s 10b5-1 plan from 9/14/21?  We need 4Q production of 309,509, which would be a monster result.

63. In other words$TSLA gained about 1% a weekLong term support levels are rising faster as the recent price advancement has slowed on a relative basisEither the stock advancement will continue to slow relatively - in preparation for macro difficulties - or prepare for surge

64. Last day of the year and unsurprisingly there is little volume in the markets. $TSLA only at 10M with 1.5 hrs to go. That being said, let’s still live stream the NYE power hour! Come join us— hit subscribe to be alerted 

65. Whilst $TSLA $AAPL $MSFT sit in my top 5 I don’t think they will return 30% or more.

66. The moon is 238,900 miles away. Does that mean $TSLA at $2389/share or $23,890/share?

67. I like this. Let's see more of it. Elon, Ross, Cathie, & several "analysts" have been part of the closely knit $tsla fraud cabal for years. Call them out, Mike. 

68. Deliveries for X and S are still happening last day of the year. Expansion is still going to expand Fremont capacity by 50%. $tsla @SawyerMerritt Looking forward to Q4 numbers.

69. $TSLA will have margins better than Apple on a product that sells for nearly 100x the price per unit of an iPhone Annual global revenue for Autosales ~$2.7 trillionSmart phone ~$404 billionLet that sink in.

70. It's about time you guys start calling out TSLA...their non-stop securities fraud is a competitive advantage over you guys who aren't running frauds...Why aren't all car makers calling them out

73. Dr Erik be playing 4D Chess with those that doubt his abilities. $bngo is the $tsla of #Genomics Have been saying that since 23rd of December 2020#Bionanians

74. Lol.The recall is irrelevant. Barely affects Tesla's bottom line. Minor issue that affects a minority of vehicles.And indeed, the stock barely moved.Also, his sales were mostly scheduled in advance.You are a failure.

75. How is it possible that Tesla is STILL so poorly understood? $1T market cap, one of the most valuable companies, deepest options pool in the world, and people can't connect dots  on China deliveries -> production & deliveries -> plausible non-GAAP EPS. Truly bizarre! $tsla

76. I always love to read Gene’s thoughts. #tesla $tsla

77. Happy New Year Eve. 2022, $NIO $TSLA $AAPL $XPEV $LI $HTZ $GGPI my Top 7 investments. I believe real estate stays hot even if rates go up. Metaverse, Crypto, VR, Headsets hopefully new products by $AAPL and $FB. Stock Market to more all time highs. DOW 40,000+ S&P 5500+

78. Thanks for all your updated $TSLA news. Much appreciated from the $TSLA family. Don’t want to see a ‘BREAKING’ Tweet till next year, lol.

79. Short interest is supposedly up 3% from the last reporting.  Therefore Elon's "selling out and therefore it's over for Tesla" Bull trap worked. Time for some seriously blockbuster earnings.$TSLA

80. Of course, as $TSLA gets into mid decade Wall Street will reduce long term growth rate to 25-50% which may result in PE compression and the stock price stalling- unless there are clear catalysts for future sustainable mega growth.  I can think of a few - Energy. Robotics. FSD. AI

81. Investing is incredibly easy. Go all in on $TSLA and you will beat the index year after year. In the past you had to do the same with Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. for amazing returns. Next decade belongs to Tesla.

82. Teslemmings: "Tesla is supply constrained, which is why its mkt share in China/Europe is dropping. They sell in Europe or China to optimize the limited supply."Also Teslemmings: "Should be some upside to my estimates if Tesla did sell 70k in China in December."$TSLA

83. $TSLA Bear case: orbit. Base case: moon. Bull case: Mars.

88. I would disagree primarily with this assumption “look out 3-5 years when other EVs are at parity” which is main reason why we see this safety argument differentlyWe should instead argue above assumption which many current $TSLA investors appear to have opposing views on

91. I've sold $TSLA shares to fund this charitable commitment. I still love Tesla and think it is an incredible company with a bright future. My Model Y is the best car I've ever owned and I wouldn't drive anything else.
